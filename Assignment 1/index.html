        <blockquote cite="https://genius.com/Lukas-graham-7-years-lyrics">
            In “7 Years”, the Danish group Lukas Graham reflect on their life and wonder about growing older.
            Nostalgia from ages 7, 11, and 20 are explored before the band goes on to wonder about their life in the
            possible future; specifically, when they are 30 or 60, or when they have kids or a wife. The song is
            piano driven with a minimal soulful beat.

            <h2>7 years by Lukas Graham</h2>
            <p>
                Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
                "Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
                Once, I was seven years old
            </p>

            <p>
                It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
                Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
                By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
                Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
            </p>

            <p>
                Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
                "Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"
                Once, I was eleven years old
            </p>

            <p>
                I always had that dream like my daddy before me
                So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
                Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
                'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
            </p>

            <p>
                Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
                Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
                Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
            </p>

            <p>
                I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
                'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
                I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
                And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
            </p>

            <p>
                Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
                I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
                Once, I was twenty years old
            </p>

            <p>
                Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
                We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
                Soon, we'll be thirty years old
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
                So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
                Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
                And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry
            </p>

            <p>
                Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
                Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
                I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
                I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
            </p>

            <p>
                Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
                Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
                Soon, I'll be sixty years old
                Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
                Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
                Soon, I'll be sixty years old
            </p>

            <p>
                Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
                "Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
                Once I was seven years old
                Once I was seven years old
